# Python-Machine-Learning

This repository contains projects I've completed from a Udemy course. I'm currently taking a Python course for machine learning, and I'm applying my knowledge in Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and K Nearest Neighbors into several projects. The datasets come from the course itself and Kaggle.
